# OpenVidStreamer
OpenVidStreamer is a video-sharing platform operating with its own unique economy, offering a monthly subscription model for users to access content. To incentivize content creation, the platform rewards users who upload videos by monetarily compensating them based on the watch time their uploads accumulate from other viewers. This system encourages active participation and content generation, enhancing the platform's value and diversity.
